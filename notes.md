clone using git clone and the URL of the repository.
Cloned repositories go in a subdirectory with the name of the repository.
push changes so that repositories are in sync. pull commits using the pull command.
steps are pull, make changes, commit changes, push changes MAKE THIS A HABIT
fetch gets info about changes without making changes. status shows differences between the clones.
use the README file to describe modifications and alterations.
