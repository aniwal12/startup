With Cookbook, users can easily share recipes with other users and request recipes from other users. Now, I don't need to call my mom every fall to get the same pumpkin bread recipe. Instead, I can surprise her with a freshly made loaf.\r ### Design\r ![User login page for the Cookbook application.](Cookbook_login.jpg)",
